Problem:  In our daily life we learn something new about some topic (Traveling) etc. We are unable to remember each things or experiences.  You might be thinking writing daily notes is the good solution to this problem but we can't organize them because of this we would not able to find details about certain topic.  Solution:  In What-I-Noted App i will provide a web interface where user can create multiple note books (Group of Notes) and can add multiple notes to it. User can Apply a easy search using tags.Adding Notes/Notebooks as Favorite and can also mark each notes as public which will show up @ Public page of our web Interface.
